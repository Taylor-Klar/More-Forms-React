The goal of this assignement was to: add error messages.
<br>
<li>If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.</li>
<li>The e-mail is less than 5 characters, say the field must be at least 5 characters.</li>
<li>The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.</li>
<li>These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.</li>
