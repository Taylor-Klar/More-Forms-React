The goal of this assignement was to: add error messages.
<br>
If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
The e-mail is less than 5 characters, say the field must be at least 5 characters.
The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.
